        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>CrunchyWrap allows you to watch the freely available anime episodes on CrunchyRoll, although it does not
                display the in-episode ads.
                Said that, it is not intended to be a way of pirate streaming anime from CrunchyRoll.</li>
            <li>CrunchyWrap is an app I developed to learn how the non-public CrunchyRoll APIs work.</li>
            <li>It is not possible to use CrunchyWrap to watch the premium episodes, even if you pay for a premium
                subscription.
                In fact, CrunchyWrap does not allow you to log in your personal CrunchyRoll account.</li>
            <li>This app and me are <span style="color: #f0668f;">IN NO WAY</span> affiliated to CrunchyRoll
                and I did not obtain permissions to use the non-public
                APIs, this whole project
                was intended as a way to practice my Android development skills.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="doc" class="content">
        <h2>How does this work?</h2>
        <p>
            The main goal of the app is to obtain direct links to the episodes <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U#File_format">.m3u8 files</a>.
            All the source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/joe2k01/CrunchyWrap">Github</a> and the
            class responsible for the API calls
            is named <a
                href="https://github.com/joe2k01/CrunchyWrap/blob/master/app/src/main/java/io/github/joe2k01/crunchywrap/ApiCalls.kt">ApiCalls.kt</a>
            <br>
            <h3>Authentication</h3>
            <div id="auth" class="doc_paragraph">
                The first step to achieve our goal is to start a session on the CrunchyRoll's server, which is
                done by a simple POST request to a particular adress: <a
                    href="https://api.crunchyroll.com/start_session.0.json">https://api.crunchyroll.com/start_session.0.json</a>
                <br>
                All the requests made by the app are posted to the same CrunchyRoll server (<a
                    href="https://api.crunchyroll.com">https://api.crunchyroll.com</a>),
                what changes is the last part of the request, for example when starting a new session it is
                start_session.0.json.
                <br>
                <br>
                Anyway, that API url is pink and you clicked on it. Unluckily you had been redirected to a
                "bad_auth_params"
                page, how dare you CrunchyRoll! That
                is because you need to attach a few parameters before posting any request. In the case of a new session
                request the required params to attach
                are:
                <ul>
                    <li>device_id: An id that represent the current device.</li>
                    <li>device_type: The app uses "com.crunchyroll.crunchyroid" as the value for this parameter. Is the
                        same
                        value used by the official app.</li>
                    <li>access_token: The token needed to authenticate on the server. I have got this value from <a
                            href="https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink">streamlink.</a></li>
                    <li>version: I assume this is their internal version of the app or something like that. Obtained
                        from
                        streamlink as the above value.</li>
                </ul>
                After posting the request, as a response we get a json file from which we obtain the session_id
                parameter
                that we will need to attach to every request from now on.
                Now that we obtained a session_id we can access pretty much every part of the API, taking advantage of
                that
                the app is able to list the "newest" animes available,
                retrieve information about any anime, which include the description of it and the available episodes.
                And of
                course the app is able to obtain a direct link to the playlist files.
            </div>
            <button id="auth_btn" onclick="showHide('auth', 'auth_btn')">Show</button>
            <br>
            <h3>List new animes</h3>
            <div id="list" class="doc_paragraph">
                To list the new animes the app posts a request to <a

                and it
                attaches a few more parameters:
                <ul>
                    <li>session_id: The id of the session, obtained with the previous call.</li>
                    <li>media_type: CrunchyRoll does not offer only anime, so the app specifies "anime".</li>
                    <li>limit: How many animes we want to know about, the app specifies "10".</li>
                </ul>
                As a response the app obtains a json files from which it extrapolates different data:
                <ul>
                    <li>name: The title of every single anime.</li>
                    <li>series_id: The id of the anime. It will later be used to list the episodes or to obtain
                        information
                        about the anime if added to the liked list.</li>
                    <li>description: The description of the anime.</li>
                    <li>portrait_image: The url of the small preview image shown in the newest section of the app.</li>
                    <li>landscape_image: The url of the wide preview image shown in the anime specific section of the
                        app.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The images are available in various resolutions, the app obtains the one marked by the "full_url" item.
            </div>
            <button id="list_btn" onclick="showHide('list', 'list_btn')">Show</button>

            <h3>Obtain information about a particular anime</h3>
            <div id="anime" class="doc_paragraph">

                </ul>
                This call will obtain as a response the same as above, strictly related to the one anime we are
                interested
                in.
